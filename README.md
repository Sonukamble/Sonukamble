### 🔭 Current Projects:
FoodNet website (In Progress): Collaborating with a friend on a Food App aimed at bringing everything together in one place for the user. The app suggests recipes based on the ingredients a user has at home, allowing users to select their available ingredients for tailored recipe suggestions. Additionally, it features a "Moody Food" function, which recommends meals based on the user’s mood. This project is still in the early stages and is being actively developed to provide a seamless and all-in-one food discovery experience

### 🌱 Learning Journey:
I’m diving deep into Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and their integration with OpenAI APIs to build intelligent applications and enhance AI-driven software solutions.
